# The dataset that we have used in this project is  
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BEHVTowXEwZhOfD0hYWT77QZui6kxeij
It is an extension to MNIST dataset.
In this project we aim to build a machine learning model which is capable of solving Hand-written mathematical equations using convolutional neural network and image processing techniques.
The project gains it's importance from the fact that today we have entered into the digital era wherein our major activities especially the education relies on softwares and devices. In such scenarios it is vital that there must be a tool that could assist students in it like instantly solving their doubts, help veryfying their solutions.
The model takes in an image of a hand-written equation and gives the solution of the equation as output.
The model involves Image segmentation, character recognation and equation solver.
Anybody can use this model without any specific knowlegde of technology.
